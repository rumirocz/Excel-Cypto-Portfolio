# Excel-Cypto-Portfolio

The portfolio I created uses one call to get the entire CoinMarketCap.com ticker and updates your specific coins in your portfolio at times you can set.

This file is a macro-enabled Excel spreedsheet. You can download it and alter the data as you see fit. As most won't want to open an untrusted macro-enable file, below are instructions on how to create you own portfolio.

Instructions:

1) Save your Excel workbook as an "Excel-Macro-Enabled Workbook" (.xlsm).
2) Open Visual Basic (On the Developer Ribbon or Alt+F11)
3) Create a new "Module" (renaming is not important)
4) Copy the data from the file "coinModule.bas" or simply import this module into your Visual Basic project
5) Copy the data from the file "thisWorkbook.bas" into the object "ThisWorkbook" in your Visual Basic project
6) Save the modules and you can close Visual Basic
7)
